# PythonLogin
# Simple login application for python
# Checks for if a user file exists
# If it does it checks if the login is correct
# if the file doesn't exist then it makes a new login file then enters the login details
# files created by the program CAN be used to login.
# No use to this application at the moment
# Feel free to expand upon this to make something if you want
